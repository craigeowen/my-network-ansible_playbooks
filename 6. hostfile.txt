The hosts file

This is the inventory for all your ansible accessible devices.

So we have already seen this in action for the linux hosts. So lets take
 a closer look and make some slight changes alonfg the way.
 
But please note, I will introduce the changes in slow time as we develop
the lab, so this will iterate a number of times.
 
The basic format is to include the host IP address or name (if in DNS)
But pretty quickly this can become difficult to deal with, 
so like most things we can group hosts into one or more groups
...and indeed group groups!
 
Also we can include variables in the hosts files..lets have an example 
(Note at this stage I am using plain text pwd...this will change in 
later labs...so stick with it for now)
(But we will not inlcude variable for the routers - these will be 
included in the playbook...and eventually migrated to a seperate 
variables files.)

 Groups:
 
 [linux]
 172.16.10.4 ansible_user=test1 ansible_ssh_pass=P4ssw0rd!
 172.16.10.5 ansible_user=test10 ansible_ssh_pass=P4ssw0rd!
 172.16.20.2 ansible_user=test2 ansible_ssh_pass=P4ssw0rd!
 172.16.30.3 ansible_user=test3 ansible_ssh_pass=P4ssw0rd!
 
 So we have the following
 - [linux] #this is the group name
 - one line per host, with a variable for login mane and a variable for 
  the ssh password.

We can make an improvement for this as I am using the same password 
for each host...I can create a sperate variable as follows and add 
some checky comments (#)

So now follows the hostfile - 

[linux]
 #site1
 172.16.10.4 ansible_user=test1
 172.16.10.5 ansible_user=test10
 #site2
 172.16.20.2 ansible_user=test2 
 #site3
 172.16.30.3 ansible_user=test3 
 
[linux:vars]
ansible_ssh_pass=P4ssw0rd!

###Now add routers

#Edge Routers
[edgerouter:children] #remember we can group groups

er-site1 # include the group of site 1 edge routers

#site 2 and 3 will be added when we grow the lab
#er-site2 
#er-site3

[er-site1] # a group for edge routers, which is then included above
172.16.10.252 #csr10 
172.16.10.253 #csr11
