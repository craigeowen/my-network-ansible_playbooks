1. Lets test what we have so far. Recap the host files includes entries
for site 1 edge routers ip addresses in vlan10
csr10 172.16.10.252
csr11 172.16.10.253

Our ansible hot is 172.16.10.10

So far I can ping and ssh from ansible host to csr10 & 11
If you cannot then troubleshoot whynot!!!

I have written a simple playbook to test that ansible works for these
edge routers. This playbook uses no password security and includes all
variables within the playbook (we will address this in the next topic)

Playbook to run Show Version against Cisco routers

site1_cisco_showVersion.yml

---
- hosts: er-site1
  gather_facts: no
  connection: local

  tasks:
  - name: show version
    ios_facts:
      gather_subset: hardware
      provider: # the variable needed for login to the router
        username: cisco
        password: P4ssw0rd!
        authorize: true
        auth_pass: P4ssw0rd!

  - name: print out the IOS version
    debug:
      var: ansible_net_version

2.  Now we can use another playbook to add loopbacks 
playbook - site1_cisco_loopbacks.yml
3. Amend host files so site 1 ip's are now loopback1
playbook - site1_cisco_loopbacks.yml
4. Add static route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 via 10.10.10.254
playbook - site1_cisco_staticRoute.yml
