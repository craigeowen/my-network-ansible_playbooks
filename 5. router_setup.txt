Instead of using an emulated environment such as GNS3 or VIRL, my aim
 is to build my entire lab in a virtualised environment. I started out
 using VirtualBox, but my laptop does not have enough resources to run
 all my VM's. I got 3 CSR routers and 2 linux hosts running, but I 
 wanted to run more. Luckily I have a VMWare ESXi host with 8 virtual
 core and 32Gb RAM, so I have dedicated it to this lab.

I also have access to the CSR1000v image as a Cisco partner. 
The CSR1000v is really easy to spin up in VMWare, the only real issue is
 that it requires 4Gb RAM.
 
Nativley ansible connects to a host on ssh and then utilises the python
interpreter to compile and run the plays. However this is not possible
on a Cisco router so on the one hand it has a mre limited set of modules
, on the other I think it makes for more streamlined and easier 
playbooks.

But given these limitations it also requires a more hands on approach
 to the initial router set up.
 
 Deploy the router and go to the command prompt via the vsphere web 
 console
 - configure hostname
   router(config)# hostname csr10
 - configure domain
   csr10(config)# ip domain-name test.com
 - configure username and password
   csr10(config)#username cisco privilege 15 secret p4ssw0rd!
 - configure the enable secret password
   csr10(config)#enable secret p4ssw0rd!!!
 - configure the ethernet interface
   csr10(config)#interface gigabitethernet1
   csr10(config-if)#ip address x.x.x.x 255.x.x.x
   csr10(config-if)# no shut
 - configre rsa crypto key
   csr10(config)#crypto key generate rsa
 - configure ssh access to vty
   csr10(config)#line vty 0 4
   csr10(config-line)#transport input ssh
   csr10(config-line)#login local
 - ssh
   csr10(config)#ip ssh version 2
   csr10(config)#ip ssh authentication-retries 2
   csr10(config)#ip ssh time-out 60
 
 Now test ssh from ansible host to router
 
[red1@localhost ansible]$ ssh cisco@<ip address>
 Once ssh access works, then the router is ready.

We will start with a sigle router and build out, using ansible as much
 as possible as we go.
