I am writing about network automation. but there is definatley a need
 to use end hosts. So given that this entire lab is virtualised it is
 easy to spin up end nodes as test targets. 

Ansible admin node
  I started ot by running ansible on an ubuntu linux distro. However I
   suffered endlessly from stability issues so switched to using RHEL7.
   This I sourced from RedHat using the free RHEL Developers 
   subscription
   https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/03/31/no-cost-rhel-developer-subscription-now-available/
   Follow the install guide and make sure to add the dependent repos
   
   I also installed the following packages onto this node:
     ansible
     putty
     TeamViewer
    
Ubuntu - site nodes
  standard ubuntu install, plus make sure ssh is set up.
  
I made sure to start out with all the linux nodes connected to the
 VM Network port group in order to carry out updates as well as ensuring
 ssh works between the ansible admin node and each of the site nodes. 
 This is really important as ansible will only work over ssh.
 
 It is also a really good idea to test ansible against each node, as
 follows:
 
   I will go into ansible in subsequent sections, so at this stage 
   add an entry into the host file as follows (1 per server).
    <ip address> ansible_user=<username> ansible_password=<password>
    change valuses between <> to your own settings
    
    172.16.20.2 ansible_user=test2 ansible_password=p4ssw0rd!
    
    Now ping to ip address to confirm connectivity
    
    Now ssh to linux host with username from above
    cd to /etc/ansible
    Then run the following: ansible all -m ping

[red1@localhost ~]$ ping 172.16.20.2
